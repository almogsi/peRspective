# peRspective 0.1.1

* Turned sleeps below 0.7 intervals into a warning (rather than error) as to give more choice to the user if they have a better API quota.

* Fixed bug where it would sometimes not correctly match the `text_id` due to one variable being numeric. Now always outputs character.

* Updated documentation to reflect changes in the Perspective API (API key retrieval, available models, etc.).
